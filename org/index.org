My name is Antti Joutsi (aka Jarizleifr) and I'm a computer tech enthusiast and an artist from Tampere, Finland.

I've been developing an old-school roguelike game called Dregsrealm as an independent developer since 2016, I do all the code, game design, graphics and music myself. I'm also employed as a tech consultant, having worked mostly on administrative frontends, webshops and e-commerce.

I'm a proponent of Zen Buddhism, I paint (mostly with acrylics and goauche) and I believe in empathy, compassion and self-betterment.

I write about various topics that interest me, especially about game development, technology, my personal philosophy and other artistic endeavours.
