#+HTML: <h2>About Me</h3>
My name is Antti Joutsi, alias ~jarizleifr~, and I'm an urban eremite, a Zen Buddhist, a scholar obsessed with myriad subjects, a computer tech enthusiast, a musician and an artist.

I currently live in Tampere, working at Vincit Oyj as a tech consultant, providing my expertise on the web, e-commerce, peripheral integration and administrative frontends.

During leisure I like to paint (acrylic and goauche mostly), engage in musical troubadoury, or develop intricate simulations for my roguelike game Dregsrealm, which I've been developing as a side-project since 2016. I hope to release the game one day.

I also write profusely about various topics that interest me, especially about game development, technology, my personal philosophy and other artistic endeavours. A selection of my more coherent writings (and paintings) can be perused at this very website.

The values I hold most dear, are empathy, compassion and self-betterment. I've grown weary of cruelty and ignorance.
