I decided to reboot my portfolio page, this time done entirely with Emacs org-mode and some CSS.

There's some satisfaction in using tools in a correct manner, not even trying to break the limitations of the document model, but instead accept it as-is, and org-mode by default excels in writing documents.

I've used static site generators like [[http://nextjs.org][Next.js]] or [[https://www.11ty.dev][11ty]] before, but not having to write even a single line of JavaScript for a static web page feels so good.
