#+TITLE: Resume
 #+DESCRIPTION: Antti Joutsi's resume
* Mission

I'm currently employed at *Vincit Oyj* as an IT-consultant, working on customer projects. Most recently I've been working mainly on frontends, using *React*, *Next.js* and *TypeScript*. Looking forward to working on a more full-stack or backend focused roles in the future.

I love learning new things, so I'm constantly building up my competence for future endeavours and just for fun. Currently I'm touching up my skills with *Lisp*, *Rust* and *OpenGL*.

* Skills

** Core proficiency
  
I've about 4 years of professional experience in game and software development. I'm most proficient with *C#*, which I've used to develop my game Dregsrealm since 2016. I've also plenty of experience with *TypeScript* and *React*. I've been in a few professional *Java* projects that used *Spring Framework*.

*Python* I use mostly for small personal utilities, *C* and *C++* I've occasionally tinkered with, but I kinda feel more the drift towards *Rust*.

I have also done some freelance work as an artist, doing album covers and posters for bands. I've some experience from audiovisual recording and editing and I've played music (guitar, keyboards) for about 20 years.
